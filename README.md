# Spotify Data Tracker
## Project Overview
This is a Pyton-based project designed to interact with the Spotify Web API to fetch adn store data like top tracks and artists over time. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.
## Features
- Fetch and save top tracks and artists: the project fetches the top tracks and artists for different time frames (short term, medium term, long term) using the Spotify API and stores that data in a MongoDB database.
- Data processing: The fetched data is processed to extract releavant details such as track/artist names, genres, followers, popularity, and audio features like energy and tempo.
- Comparison: the project includes functionality to compare the top tracks and artists over time, highlighting changes in ranking and new entries.
- Logging: comprehensive logging is implemented to track the execution of the scripts and to capture errors.

## Key Componets 
- `config/`: Loads the enviroment variables stored in a `.env` file, which is not included in the repository for security reasons. Also contains the autogenerated Spotify access token.
- `database/`: Contains scripts related to database connection and operations. connect.py establishes the connection to the MongoDB cluster, and operations.py contains functions for saving and retrieving data.
- `logs/`: Contains the logging configuration `logging_config.py` and the log file `spotify_data.log`, which records the script's execution details.
- `scripts/`: This is where the main executable scripts are located:
    - `main.py`: Fetches, processes, and saves top tracks and artists to the database.
    - `compare.py`: Compares the current top tracks with previous ones, displaying changes in rankings.
- `utils/`: Contains utility scripts:
    - `auth.py`: Handles authentication with the Spotify API.
    - `fetch.py`: Functions to fetch top tracks and artists from the Spotify API.
    - `process_data.py`: Functions to process the fetched data, extracting relevant details for storage.
